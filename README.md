# portfolio
Hello! This is the program for the final assignment and project, integrating the portfolio, the yatzy game, the labs, php and database functionality all in one.

You can run this webapp by opening index.html in live server. In the portfolio itself, you'll find there's three main pages. The homepage with button links to other pages, the resume done in Assignment 1, and the projects and other assignments page. The final project focuses on the projects page. There, you will find a link to some projects done in the course, but the main project worked on for Assignment 4 are the different versions of the Yatzy game.

The Yatzy game has three versions. Version 1, made for Assignment 2, uses JavaScript and HTML to make the basic structure of the game. Version 2, made for Assignment 3, uses AJAX to dynamically roll dice. Version 3, made for this Assignment, uses an API to attach to a database and display the high scores.

More details about the Yatzy can be found under the README file or the github page of the 'yatzy' repository.
